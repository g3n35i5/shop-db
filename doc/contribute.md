## How to contribute

#### Commit Messages

You should format the commit messages like this:
```
models: introduce new class Consumer

Since we have some people that consume our products
we want to save them individually in the database.
```

While reading the above commit, please note the following:

We use one of the following prefixes in the first line of the commit:
- models (for data storage related changes)
- doc (for documentation, readmes, ... which can not
  be committed together with the changes that introduced
  the aspects of these new documentation. This will be helpful
  if documentation is added later.)
- additional prefixes may be added later


#### Bugs:

Are not existing. Please consider them as features.
